## ✨ The Front-End Edge: Blending Code with Strategy
My approach to development combines technical expertise with strategic design thinking, ensuring every feature is robust and goal-driven:

- **User Experience (UX) First:** Every technical and design decision is aligned with optimizing the User Experience (UX), informed by my experience in Digital Marketing to meet measurable business and branding objectives.
- **Unified Design System:** Successfully implemented a global CSS structure (`public/css/style.css`) to enforce consistency and a strong visual identity across all navigation, header, and footer elements.
